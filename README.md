# Portfolio for UX/UI Module at DCI

My personal portfolio page designed while studying at Digital Career Institute in Berlin, Germany

## Process:
- I decided to build this webpage with with vanilla CSS and HTML instead of using Bootstrap and Sass, so I could have more flexibility with styles and more ownership over the design.
- Although it is a solo project, I wanted to get more practice with git and GitHub so I used branches to design individual components/pages and build the site piece by piece, before merging into main.
- I wanted to make it as easy as possible to add more pages in the future so I designed a template for the homepage first. This way I could take the same basic design from the homepage for the projects page and simply rename the containers in CSS and adjust the styling where needed.
